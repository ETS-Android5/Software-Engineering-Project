# Bread Tunes Vision Statement

Bread Tunes is a music manager and player for Android devices. This music player will be able to play music files in the device's internal and external memory (such as an SD card). People will be able to browse their music library and perform several actions on their music including: finding and playing songs, seeing information about what's playing, creating their own playlists, and adding songs to a queue. Bread Tunes will also feature a Parental Control that enables parents to hide flagged songs from children.

Bread Tunes will have features focused on assisting people in finding their music painlessly. A person's music can be shown by Artist, Album, Track, Genre, or Playlist, depending on how they want to view their music. The music player will feature recently played, most played and recently added playlists, all of which are automatically updated by the application. A search function will also be included so that people can apply their own textual filter to their music.

Since people may store their music on different places in their phone's storage or on an SD card, Bread Tunes will provide the ability for a person to choose the folder(s) where music is stored on their device. This gives people flexibility - allowing them to have their music in multiple folders contained inside external or internal storage.

The Parental Control for this music player will be simple to use so that parents can filter their music based on what they don't want their children to listen to. Music can be flagged as age restricted, which may then be filtered out by the interface with a Parental Control toggle. To turn off the parental filter, a password will need to be entered. If someone is not a parent and has no use for this feature, they will be able to turn the Parental Control feature off in the Settings.

To stand out from the competition, Bread Tunes will provide a great user experience and user interface with optional Parental Controls. A lot of music players available for Android are cluttered with features that the average user does not need, such as being able to customize the interface and providing excessive settings. The aim will be to get rid of a lot of the clutter and keep things simple. Parental Controls are not usually included in music players and we think this feature will be appreciated by parents.

The success criteria for Bread Tunes are based on the following:

- Our target users should be able to choose and play a song 15% faster than with a comparable music player.
- 75% of our target users should rate the interface as cleaner and more intuitive than a comparable music player.
- 75% of parents should indicate that the music flagging and parental control interface is not difficult to use and is sufficient for what they require.



# Description of Intended Users

This music player is targeted towards regular people of any age who want a no-frills music player, and to parents who want to share music with their children. Bread Tunes is not focused on satisfying the needs of "pro users" who require equalizers or extensive customization features.



# Major Functionality

BreadTunes allows people to play the songs they have on their device. There is also the ability to flag songs as inappropriate, so that specific songs can be hidden from the music player. The song flagging feature was targeted towards parents, as they can let their children use their phone for music without fear of them listening to explicit or inappropriate songs they don't want their children to listen to.

The built-in queue can be used by long pressing on a song and choosing "Add to Queue" or "Add to Play Next".

Songs can be flagged by long pressing on a song and choosing "Flag Song".

People can turn parental mode on by clicking on the lock icon at the top of the screen.
