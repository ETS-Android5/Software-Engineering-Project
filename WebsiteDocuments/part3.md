# Development Postmortem Report

## Question 1: Ensure that you discuss the area you identified for improvement after your iteration 2 retrospective; how did it go? (Raven)

An area of improvement that was identified after iteration 2 was increasing the communication with the team. In iteration 3, the team was successful in doing this by having no less than 2 in-person meetings outside class hours.
The team was also able to practice the "Slack stand-up meetings" to keep everyone updated with their progress and ask for help in the obstacles they encountered. The #repository channel in the team's Slack group was a huge help
do keep track of changes done in master and inspect the changes closely for better understanding of the changes that have been pushed. As what has been reflected on and planned after iteration 2, the overall communication of the
team has improved a lot and this has definitely helped with the progress of the project.
