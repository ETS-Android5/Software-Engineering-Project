# Bread Tunes Vision Statement

Bread Tunes is a music manager and player for Android devices. This music player will be able to play music files in the device's internal and external memory (such as an SD card). People will be able to browse their music library and perform several actions on their music including: finding and playing songs, seeing information about what's playing, creating their own playlists, and adding songs to a queue. Bread Tunes will also feature a Parental Control that enables parents to hide flagged songs from children.

Bread Tunes will have features focused on assisting people in finding their music painlessly. A person's music can be shown by Artist, Album, Track, Genre, or Playlist, depending on how they want to view their music. The music player will feature recently played, most played and recently added playlists, all of which are automatically updated by the application. A search function will also be included so that people can apply their own textual filter to their music.

Since people may store their music on different places in their phone's storage or on an SD card, Bread Tunes will provide the ability for a person to choose the folder(s) where music is stored on their device. This gives people flexibility - allowing them to have their music in multiple folders contained inside external or internal storage.

The Parental Control for this music player will be simple to use so that parents can filter their music based on what they don't want their children to listen to. Music can be flagged as age restricted, which may then be filtered out by the interface with a Parental Control toggle. To turn off the parental filter, a password will need to be entered. If someone is not a parent and has no use for this feature, they will be able to turn the Parental Control feature off in the Settings.

To stand out from the competition, Bread Tunes will provide a great user experience and user interface with optional Parental Controls. A lot of music players available for Android are cluttered with features that the average user does not need, such as being able to customize the interface and providing excessive settings. The aim will be to get rid of a lot of the clutter and keep things simple. Parental Controls are not usually included in music players and we think this feature will be appreciated by parents.

The success criteria for Bread Tunes are based on the following:

- Our target users should be able to choose and play a song 15% faster than with a comparable music player.
- 75% of our target users should rate the interface as cleaner and more intuitive than a comparable music player.
- 75% of parents should indicate that the music flagging and parental control interface is not difficult to use and is sufficient for what they require.



# Description of Intended Users

This music player is targeted towards regular people of any age who want a no-frills music player, and to parents who want to share music with their children. Bread Tunes is not focused on satisfying the needs of "pro users" who require equalizers or extensive customization features.



# Major Functionality

The following are the general features we implemented:

- Playing music from device. There are four test songs in the application if the user does not have any music on their device. Our application also gets all the music stored on the device and allows those songs to be played.
- Finding songs. We implemented a search function so that people can find specific songs.
- Displaying music information. There is a "Now Playing" screen where people can see the current song's name, album, artist, as well as album art. On this screen, users can control music playback, too.
- Queueing music. People can long-click on a song in the list to play it next, or add it to the end of the queue. There is a button on the main page that brings up the current queue.
- Parental controls. Parents can long-click on songs in the list to flag them. They can then turn on parental mode so that those songs are hidden from the player until the mode is turned off.
