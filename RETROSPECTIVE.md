## Group 15
### Project Retrospective

complete a retrospective activity based on your work from the previous iteration: discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked, and how it can be improved in this iteration (do this early!). 

Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective).

include a chart (as an image) showing the 2 data points of project velocity from the last two iterations. Submit with this iteration a short (500 word written) description of what you have discussed, as a file called RETROSPECTIVE.md in your git repository.

-----------------------------------------------

A part of the project our group was unsatisfied with was time management. In iteration 0 and iteration 1, we managed to comfortably finish work around 4 days before the due date. However, for iteration 2 we finished our release on the day it was due. It was surprising to see our team working against the clock when in previous iterations this had not been a concern. Leaving work until the end leads to buggy releases and a greater chance of code smells in our work. We have concluded that what lead to a rushed iteration 2 release was the lack of meetings and updates at the early stages of the iteration. Meetings started during the last two weeks of the iteration, which slowed down our work considerably.For iteration 3, we plan to go back to our working procedure in iteration 1, plus other new measures to ensure a timely release.

To ensure a smooth iteration 3 release we plan to increase communication in the team. During 

we are not happy with timing ,last iteration time management and misunderstadnment

start meeting from the beginning of the iteration, not until the last week. increase commmunicatino on our progress perhaps implement standup meetings on the slack updating each other on our progress. We would consider this succesful if there is a release ready conforming to all standards in the rubric ready at least two days before Iteration 3 is due.
