# Group 15 Final Project - Winter 2019

This application was built for COMP3350, Software Engineering 1 at the University of Manitoba. The point of this project was to create an Android application with good coding practices, a 3-layer architecture, and various levels of testing.

We ended up building a music player. The player we built, **BreadTunes**, allows a user to play songs from their device. We also built in the ability to flag songs as inappropriate, so that specific songs can be hidden from the music player. This feature was targeted towards parents, as they can let their children use their phone for music without fear of them listening to explicit or inappropriate songs they don't want their children to listen to.

The initial vision for BreadTunes can be seen in the [vision](Documents/VISION.md) document.
