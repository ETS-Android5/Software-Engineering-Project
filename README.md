Bread Tunes Vision Statement

Bread Tunes is a music manager and player for Android devices. This music player will be able to play music files in the device's internal and external memory (such as an SD card). People will be able to browse their music library and perform several actions on their music including: finding and playing songs, seeing information about what's playing, creating their own playlists, and adding songs to a queue. Bread Tunes will also feature a Parental Control that enables parents to hide flagged songs from children.

Bread Tunes will have features focused on assisting people in finding their music painlessly. A search function will be included so that people can quickly find their music. A person's music can be shown by Artist, Album, Track, Genre, or Playlist, depending on how they want to view for their music. The music player will also feature recently played, most played and recently added playlists. These playlists will be automatically updated by the application.

Since people may store their music on different places in their phone's storage or on an SD card, Bread Tunes will provide the ability for a person to choose the folder(s) where music is stored on their device. This gives people flexibility - allowing them to have their music in multiple folders contained inside external or internal storage.

The Parental Control for this music player will be simple to use so that parents can filter their music based on what they don't want their children to listen to. Music can be flagged as age restricted and a toggle will be provided by the interface to filter out the flagged songs. To turn off the parental filter, a password will need to be entered. If someone is not a parent and has no use for this feature, they will be able to turn the Parental Control feature off in the Settings.

This music player is targeted towards regular people of any age who want a no-frills music player, as well as to parents who want to share music with their children. Bread Tunes is not focused on satisfying the needs of "pro users" who require equalizers or extensive customization features.

To stand out from the competition, Bread Tunes will provide a great user experience and user interface with optional Parental Control. A lot of music players available for Android are cluttered with features that the average user does not need such as being able to customize the interface and providing excessive settings. The aim will be to get rid of a lot of the clutter and keep things simple. Parental Controls are not usually included in music players and we think this feature will be appreciated by parents..

The success criteria for Bread Tunes are based on the following:

- Our target users should be able to choose and play a song 15% faster than with a comparable music player.
- Our target users should rate the interface as cleaner and more intuitive than a comparable music player.
- Parents should be able to indicate that the music flagging and parental control interface is not difficult to use and is sufficient for what they require.
