# Bread Tunes Vision Statement


Bread Tunes is a music manager and player for music stored locally on an Android device. This music player will be able to play music files that a person owns on local or external storage. People will be able to navigate their library of music, choose what they want to listen to, play their music, see information about what's playing, create their own playlists, and add music to a queue. Bread Tunes will also include Parental Controls so a parent can choose to flag music that they don't want their children listening to.

Bread Tunes will have features focused on assisting people in finding their music painlessly. A search function will be included so that users can enter text to find their music. A person's music can be shown by Artist, Album, Track, Genre, or Playlist, depending on how they want to search for their music. There will be a recently played, a most played, and a favourites category as well so that people can find music by these criteria.

Since people may store their music on different places in their phone's storage or on an SD card, Bread Tunes will provide the ability for someone to choose the folder(s) where music is stored on their device. This gives the user flexibility so that they don't necessarily need their music in a Music folder, and so that they can include music from both internal and external storage.

The Parental Controls for this music player will be simple to use so that parents can filter their music based on what they don't want their children to listen to. Music can be flagged as explicit or inappropriate by parents, and a toggle will be provided by the interface to filter out the flagged songs. To turn off the parental filter, a password will need to be entered. If someone is not a parent and has no use for this feature, they will be able to turn the Parental Control feature off in the Settings.

This music player is targeted towards regular people of any age who want a no-frills music player, and to parents who want to be able to let their children listen to their music. Bread Tunes is not focused on satisfying the needs of pro users who want to play with equalizers or customize their music players.

To stand out from the competition, Bread Tunes will provide a great user experience and user interface with optional Parental Controls. A lot of music players available for Android are cluttered with features that the average user does not need such as being able to customize the interface and providing excessive settings/tweaks. The aim will be to get rid of a lot of the clutter and keep things simple. As well, Parental Controls are not included with many music players available for Android which we think parents will appreciate.

The success criteria for Bread Tunes are based on the following:

- Our target users should be able to choose and play the song they want faster than with a comparable music player.
- Our target users should rate the interface as cleaner and more intuitive than a comparable music player.
- Parents should be able to indicate that the music flagging and parental control interface is not difficult to use and is sufficient for what they require.
