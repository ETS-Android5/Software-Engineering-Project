### Project Retrospective

***

This retrospective document is an analysis of certain things our team was not satisfied with, in terms of working together and project delivery. The point of doing this is to improve the ways we work together in the future, and to have an open, honest discussion about what we could do better to get more quality work done.

One part of the project our group was unsatisfied with was time management. In iteration 0 and iteration 1, we managed to comfortably finish work around 4 days before the due date. However, for iteration 2 we finished our release on the day it was due. It was surprising to see our team working against the clock when in previous iterations this had not been a concern. The team ended up rushing to get iteration 2 released, and ended up releasing some sub-optimal work. Rushing to finish an iteration is not ideal since it could lead to buggy releases. Additionally, rushing may end up accumulating greater technical debt, and result in more "code smells" in the repository.

We have concluded that what lead to a rushed iteration 2 release was the lack of meetings and updates at the beginning of the iteration. The team ended up starting meetings during the last two weeks of the iteration, which slowed down our work considerably. For iteration 3, we plan to go back to our meeting procedure during iteration 1, plus other new measures to ensure a timely release.

To ensure a smooth iteration 3 release, the general goal is to increase communication within the team. We plan to have bi-weekly in-person meetings (at the minimum). The meetings will happen from the early stages of the iteration and will continue until the due date without pause. The team will also experiment with having daily "Slack stand-up meetings" where we will update all of the members on what we have been working on and if there is any obstacles in our way. The team is also encouraged to use the #repo channel on Slack where GitLab has been configured to send notifications of changes to the master branch. Doing this will allow each team member to review the other team members' contributions and code. This will help decrease code smells and will reduce the amount of bugs caused when people work out of their "areas of expertise". Most importantly, constant code reviews will foster ownership and responsibility for every addition to master.

If bi-weekly meetings are sustained and at least 5 "Slack stand-up meetings" are held each week, the team would consider this a successful experiment if:

- The release for iteration 3 is finished at least two days before the due date
- Fewer code smells are introduced at release time relative to previous releases

In addition to an early release, the release will ideally adhere to the highest requirements established in the rubric on UMLearn for Iteration 3. Putting out good releases in the future will be a balancing act between committing quality work, team communication, and giving ample time to create a release.

The following is the project velocity for this team's work. The amount of work increased from iteration 1 to iteration 2. The rushed release we had for iteration 2 was very likely a result of the combination of more work, and a later start on that work compared to iteration 1.
